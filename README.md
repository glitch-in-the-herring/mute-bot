# Mutebot
A simple bot that mutes and unmutes everyone in a discord voice channel

## Usage
To run the bot, use  
```python3 main.py [-t TOKEN] [-p PREFIX]```
If you do not provide a prefix, the bot defaults to `$`.

To mute everyone, use `$mute`. To unmute everyone, use `$unmute`.  
To deafen everyone, use `$deafen`. To undeafen everyone use `$undeafen`.
Make sure you are connected to a voice channel, and have the proper permissions in the voice channel.
